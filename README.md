# RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program

Welcome to the **RISC-V Reference SoC Tapeout Program**, organized by **VSD**.  

This repository documents the progress of my participation in the program, detailing the **RTL-to-GDS tapeout flow**, the tools used, and the learning outcomes throughout the course.  

**Role:** RISC-V Learner & Contributor

## Overview

This program provides hands-on exposure to **digital design and SoC tapeout processes**, guiding participants through the industry-standard flow from **RTL design to GDSII generation**.  

By participating, I aim to:  
- Gain in-depth knowledge of **Verilog** and **RTL design methodologies**.  
- Understand **industrial EDA tools** such as **Yosys**, **iVerilog**, and **GTKWave**.  
- Document and track my learning and progress systematically.
